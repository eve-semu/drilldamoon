# drilldamoon

_drilldamoon_ is a website that can help you and your corporation to better plan and execute moon-mining operations in EVE-online.  Basically there are three different sets of features _drilldamoon_ offers, depending on the number of esi-permissions you choose to give when you login.

#### Station Manager
If you have the corporation-role "Station_Manager" in-game you can enable _drilldamoon_ for your corporation by ticking the box "Station Manager" and logging in. Once logged in you can:
* see all refineries your corporation has (including name, location, fuel level, state)
* set permissions per refinery specifying who is allowed to see the structure when logging in to _drilldamoon_. You can set permissions for single characters, corporations and/or alliances.
* transfer the structure to some other corporation which might be useful if you are also lending the structure to this corporation currently. If you do that this corporation may activate the structure for their own members.
* check when ongoing pulls of your refineries will finish to be better able to plan when to setup the next pull.
* add a moon-scan and information about installed rigs to your refineries to improve the information _drilldamoon_ is able to show to users.

#### Accountant
If you have the corporation-role "Accountant" in-game you can enable _drilldamoon_ for your corporation by ticking the box "Accountant" and logging in. This enables _drilldamoon_ to track ongoing (and past) mining-operations for your refineries. The collected data will be used to show more useful information to logged in users. As an accountant you can:
* see a summary of passed mining-operations for all your corporation structures.
* generate a report of a specific mining-operation that you can share with whomever you want via a link.

#### Normal user
As normal user you don't have to provide any esi-permissions to _drilldamoon_. But, you still need to authenticate with your EVE-online character so that _drilldamoon_ can generate a list of refineries you are allowed to see. This list is based on permissions other logged in "Station Managers" have given you (or your corporation/alliance). Once logged in you will be able to see (for every refinery you have permissions for):
* name, owner, location, pull-timer (eta), cycle-time (of the current pull)
* ore-types and their quality the asteroid field will contain. You may also see the exact ratios if the station-manager has provided that information.

If the corporation owning the structure has an Accountant logged in to _drilldamoon_ you will also see if there is an active asteroid-field and stats about this mining operation (like how many players are taking part in it).

If you choose to grant the set_waypoint_permission on login to _drilldamoon_ you can set a waypoint to a refinery for your EVE-character directly via the website. You can even add multiple characters to your _drilldamoon_ account and set the waypoints for all of them at once.
